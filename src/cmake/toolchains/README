# Toolchain files

These files provide some early configuration during cmake configuration + some
compile time flags. These toolchain files have been written to work for our
`ricochet-build` repository, for cross compiling on a linux-(x86_64|i386) host.

If you are trying to cross compile for another platform (or one which we
provide a toolchain file for), you may have to manually specify the
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` on the command line (or in a cmake GUI) in order to
successfully build.
