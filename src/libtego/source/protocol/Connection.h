/* Represents a protocol connection associated with a socket
 *
 * Connection is created to handle protocol communication over a socket. It
 * handles reading, writing, creating channels, and all protocol behavior. A
 * connection instance is created for a specific socket and cannot be changed.
 * When the socket is closed, the Connection closes all channels and cannot be
 * used again.
 *
 * All protocol behavior takes place by creating and using channels, represented
 * by subclasses of Channel. The channelCreated and channelOpened signals can be
 * used to attach to new channels. A new channel can be created by instantiating
 * it and calling its openChannel method.
 *
 * The socket and all channels are owned by the Connection instance. In
 * particular, channel instances will be deleted automatically after being
 * closed. Avoid storing pointers to channels, or use a safe pointer to do so.
 *
 * The channel's functionality is controlled by authentication grants and by its
 * assigned purpose. The purpose declares the current use of the channel (e.g.
 * for a known contact or an incoming contact request). Higher level classes
 * assign and change the connection's purpose. Connections with an Unknown
 * purpose are closed automatically after a short timeout.
