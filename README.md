### What is Ricochet Refresh?
Ricochet Refresh is an instant messanger where no one knows your identity, who you're talking to, or what you're talking about.
  * You can talk to whoever you want, without them knowing your identity (or IP address)
  * No one can know who you're talking to, or when you're talking to them<sup>*</sup> (no metadata)
  * You talk *directly* to your contact - there's no middleman server that could be compromised, putting you at risk.
  * It's cross-platform, easy to install, and easy to use!
  * It's open source, and open to contribution!

### How does it work?
Ricochet Refresh uses the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) to establish a peer-to-peer connection between you and your contact. Ricochet Refresh creates a service on the Tor network which contacts can connect to. Tor's rendezvous system makes it extremely difficult for anyone to learn the identity of a Tor user, including you.

Ricochet Refresh is not affiliated with, or endorsed by, The Tor Project.

### Disclaimer
Security and anonymity are difficult, complicated, and deep topics. We strongly encourage you to evaluate your risks, threats, and exposure with any software. *Do not rely on Ricochet Refresh for your safety*. We believe Ricochet Refresh does a really good job at protecting your privacy and anonymity, however, we can not guarantee this protection.
